## MySQL Practice: Employee Data Analysis
# üìå Overview

This repository contains a MySQL practice session where I explored employee data across different departments and job titles. The goal was to strengthen my understanding of SQL queries, including aggregation, grouping, joins, and table modifications.

# üõ† Skills Practiced

Database & Table Creation: Creating databases and tables with appropriate columns and constraints.

Data Insertion & Cleanup: Populating tables, bulk insertions, and deleting unnecessary data.

Aggregation Functions: Using COUNT, AVG, and SUM to analyze data.

Grouping Data: Using GROUP BY to summarize departmental data.

Filtering Aggregated Data: Using HAVING to filter grouped results.

Joins: Combining multiple tables with INNER JOIN.

Table Modification & Indexing: Adding, modifying, and dropping columns and indexes.

Rollup Summaries: Using WITH ROLLUP to calculate subtotals and totals.

## üîç Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated

Aggregations: COUNT, AVG, SUM

Grouping: GROUP BY on single and multiple columns
